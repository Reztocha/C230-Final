# C230-Final
The Gaming Room current has a game called Draw It or Lose. Players are broken into teams and switch turns for each round. In each round an image load gradually on the screen and the team has 30 seconds to guess what phrase, title, or thing the image represents before it is fully rendered. If the team does not guess, the remaining teams have 15 seconds to share one guess of what the solution is. A full game runs on minute.
The Gaming Room is seeking development for desktop-based operating systems as well as iOS and Android mobile platforms. They are looking for the application to run in the web browser of each platform with the capability to communicate with the back-end application on the server.

In the design document, there are several sections that address portions of the application that will affect how the game is run. The main areas of interest would be the following sections:
Design Constraints, System Architecture View, Domain Model, Evaluation, and Recommendations

The Gaming Room mentioned that there would be 200 high-definition image files to choose from (each one approximately 8 megabytes in size). In the Evaluation section, file size is mentioned in regards to cost when selecting storage management. The storage and access decisions would also affect the game-play. So, in revisions of this document, it would be best to mention possible solutions if the size of the files cannot be changed. For example, using an image CDN or converting the file type.

The overall breakdown of the document as far the needs of the client and the different choices that can be made, especially in the Evalution section, will prove useful for future projects as well.
